## Example for the Modeling Tool (ERD only)

This repository contains examples to demonstrate and test the function of the modeling tool. Various examples are intended to show the various possibilities of how a graphical model can be read into the framework.

For a quick start, it is recommended to import the examples for Postman and use them. You can find the file at `examples-modeling/postman/erd_modeling.json`.
